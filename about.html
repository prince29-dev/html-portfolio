<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hi, I'm Prince Rao, a passionate engineering student and aspiring software developer. 
I enjoy building innovative projects that combine creativity and technology, 
whether itâ€™s developing web applications, working on AI/ML ideas, or solving real-world problems 
through smart solutions. My interests lie in web development, machine learning, and core computer science, 
and I am continuously learning and experimenting with new tools to grow as a developer.  
Beyond coding, I love collaborating with communities, participating in hackathons, and taking on challenges 
that push me out of my comfort zone. This portfolio is a glimpse into my journey, skills, and projects.
